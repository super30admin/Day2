// Time Complexity : pop,peek,empty - O(1) and for push its O(n)
// Space Complexity : O(n) -- not sure about this
// Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
// Any problem you faced while coding this : Had to brainstorm with regards to 2 stack method.
/* When we put something into stack1 to make it FIFO as Queue -- 
 * we need to always have the newly coming element at the very bottom of the stack and the oldest one at the very top.
 * Hence we try to empty the stack1 at the very first (by adding the popped elements one by one to stack2 - 
 * then push the new element to stack1 -- and then again push the elements back from stack2 to stack1 
 * newElement=3 - stack1=9 stack2=empty; -- stack2 = 9;stack1 = 3 -- stack1=3,9; stack2=empty ;
 * Basically swapping the elements using 2 stacks --  also sometimes referred to reversed stack technique (check once!)
