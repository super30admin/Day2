# Time Complexity:
# put, get, remove: Average O(1) for hash computation and bucket traversal; 
# worst-case O(n) when all keys hash to the same bucket (collision).
# Space Complexity:
# Overall: O(n + m), where n is the number of keys and m is the number of buckets (self.size). 
# Each bucket stores key-value pairs independently.
# Explanation:
# Hash Function: The hash(key) method determines the bucket index by taking the modulo of the key 
# with the fixed size, ensuring uniform distribution.
# Collision Handling: Each bucket is a list, and for operations (put, get, remove), 
# the bucket is traversed to find or update the key-value pair.
# Dynamic Storage: If the key doesnâ€™t exist, it appends to the bucket; 
# if it does, the value is updated or the key is removed as needed.
